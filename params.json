Not to forget, you could directly put files in HDFS by copying your files in the local file system.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to use NFSGateway for your Hortonworks cluster _(I am using HDP 2.3)_, you would often be puzzled about where to find the mount point location i.e. The filesystem where you can see all the files being kept in hdfs.\r\nAlthough, Ambari will show you that NFSGateway is successfully running in the dashboard, it means it has only started the rpcbind and nfs services _(I run it on my master node which happens to be my namenode)_\r\n\r\nSo, you need to mount the hdfs to a location on your local filesystem manually. And here's how you can do it:\r\n\r\nFirst create a directory named say for example, `/hdfs-local` (requires sudo rights)\r\n\r\nThen add the following configuration in your /etc/fstab file (requires sudo rights)\r\n\r\n`localhost:/ /hdfs_local nfs rw,vers=3,proto=tcp,nolock,timeo=600 0 0`\r\n\r\nThen Run the following command (Requires sudo rights)\r\n\r\n`mount -t nfs -o vers=3,proto=tcp,nolock localhost:/ /hdfs-local`\r\n\r\nNOTE: This assumes you are running the NFSGateway on the current node where you're trying to mount it (localhost used in the config)\r\n\r\n### Spark Shuffle tuning for optimal performance with Joins in Dataframes\r\nComing soon\r\n\r\n### Performing Background tasks in Spring and Message Queues\r\nComing soon\r\n\r\n### Using nginx to secure your web services better\r\nComing soon\r\n\r\n### The Importance of Forward Slash in nginx\r\nOften when using ngnix as a reverse proxy and providing the proxy pass as a URL to, for example, some service running on a webserver, there are some problems when the user tries to use the nginx url.\r\n\r\nFor example in this configuration\r\n\r\n    location /resources {\r\n        proxy_pass   http://tomcat-backend-server:8080/ResourceStatus/rest/status/;\r\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\r\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf I try to access the url by http://ngnix-proxy-server-address/resources , this would work fine, but if I or my broswer puts a forward slash http://ngnix-proxy-server-address/resources/, then this would fail as the mapping for tomcat backend server then becomes ResourceStatus/rest/status//, which is undefined. \r\nHence, when providing the proxy_pass, remove the forward slash from the end of the url, to avoid any problems.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nBlog of @apurva3000 Check out my repos at [repo list](https://github.com/apurva3000)\r\n",
